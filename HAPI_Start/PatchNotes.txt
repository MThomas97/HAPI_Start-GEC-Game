< A list of major additions e.g. classes, functions > 

Tests
-----

Tested the movement of WASD & scroll wheel extensively.
Set amount of stars on screen to 10 million which it doesn’t crash it still works but at low FPS (as expected)
A lot of tests have been done to make sure the milestone has been met to the right standard.

Notes
-----

Add movement for dragging the mouse on the screen so the stars move.
Optimise the code more to gain more FPS.
