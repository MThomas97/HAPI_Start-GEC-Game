Michael Thomas
Milestone 3 <Version 3> and <09/11/2017>
--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------

Loads sprites
Blitting with alpha transparency
Blitting with no alpha
WASD keys move alphaThing sprite(up, down left, right)
Controller analog stick moves sprite (up, down, left, right)
Multiple sprites can be rendered by using the same file that was loaded

Code Additions
--------------

Added: 
Visualisation Class:
	-initialise() creates a widow that is displayed
	-ClearToColour() clears the screen to a colour for each frame
	-RenderSprite() renders the sprite 
	-RenderNoAlphaSprite() renders the sprite to the screen
	
Sprite Class:
	-Load() Loads the sprite onto the screen and checks if the file is found, if not a error message appears
	-Render() blits the sprite to the screen and sets alpha blending to true so the sprite can blend
	-RenderNoAlphaSprite() blits the sprite to the screen and sets alpha blending to false (faster performance for sprites that don't need alpha blending)
	
Rectangle Class
	-Translate() translates the clipped rectangle to the screen space by posX and posY

	-ClipTo() clips and checks the texture against the screen

	-CompletelyOutside() returns true or false whether the sprite is completely outside the screen or not

	-CompletelyInside() returns true or false whether the sprite is completely inside the screen or not

	int left, right, top, bottom;
	int width() const { return right - left; }
	int height() const { return bottom - top; }


Tests
-----

Tested the movement of WASD extensively.
Set resolution to different sizes to see if it breaks or not (doesn't)
Added parameters so the sprite clips efficently when it goes off screen and is crash free
A lot of tests have been done to make sure the milestone has been met to the right standard.
Tested multiple sprites on screen
Tested whether an error will appear if texture isnt loaded correctly

Notes
-----

Make Start class posX, posY variables not public for anyone to change and see
Optimise the code more to gain more FPS.
