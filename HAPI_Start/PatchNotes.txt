Tests

Tested the movement of WASD extensively.
Set resolution to different sizes to see if it breaks or not (doesn't)
Added parameters so the sprite clips efficently when it goes off screen and is crash free
A lot of tests have been done to make sure the milestone has been met to the right standard.
Tested multiple sprites on screen
Tested whether an error will appear if texture isnt loaded correctly

Notes

Need to set a clock tick to animations
Make Start class posX, posY variables not public for anyone to change and see
Optimise the code more to gain more FPS.
