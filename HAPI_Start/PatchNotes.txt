Loads textures
Blitting with alpha transparency
Blitting with no alpha
WASD keys move alphaThing sprite(up, down left, right)

Code Additions
--------------

Added: 
classes: Graphics, Textures, Start
functions: LoadTexture, Blit, BlitNoAlpha


Tests
-----

Tested the movement of WASD extensively.
Set resolution to different sizes to see if it breaks or not (doesn't)
Added parameters so the sprite can't go off screen and crash the program and tested it
A lot of tests have been done to make sure the milestone has been met to the right standard.

Notes
-----

Make texture class variables not public for anyone to change and see
Optimise the code more to gain more FPS.
